1. Install Python
2. Open terminal and enter "pip install -r requirements.txt"
3. Install ffmpeg(https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html)
4. add ffmpeg/bin folder to environment variable "Path"
5. open "start.cmd" and enter the twitch archive url or twitch username
6. You can change a download speed by changing "lim" parameter of TSFilesDownloader in main.py
7. After the download, I recommend you to remove temporary folders (which contains ts files)
